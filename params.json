{"name":"Kid Income Blog","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Kid Income Blog\r\nHello.  Welcome to my blog.  My name is Isaac V. and I am 13 years old.  I like to play video games, skate on my longboard, and program.  I am going to be using this blog to show others how to make income on the web.  I am starting with the basics and will try to create several web businesses that make money.  Along the way, I will be learning about web business and I will show all of the steps that it took to get there.  \r\n\r\n### Blog Post 1 - Markdown Basics\r\nFor my first post, I need to decide what kind of web businesses I am going to try to create.  When I say **web business**, I really mean anything that is either web or mobile.  Some of my options could be:\r\n\r\n1. create a web game\r\n2. create a mobile game\r\n3. create a Youtube channel\r\n4. create a web site for myself\r\n5. create a web site for other people\r\n\r\nThere are some other options, but those are some starting ideas.  One of my goals is to get my businesses started with as little money as possible.  That way, if I fail, it didn't cost that much and I can move onto another idea.","google":"UA-8129460-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
