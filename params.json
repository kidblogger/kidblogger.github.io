{"name":"Kid Income Blog","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to Kid Income Blog\r\nHello.  Welcome to my blog.  My name is Isaac V. and I am 13 years old.  I like to play video games, skate on my longboard, and program.  I am going to be using this blog to show others how to make income on the web.  I am starting with the basics and will try to create a web business that makes money.  Along the way, I will be learning about web business and I will show all of the steps that it took to get there.  I will be getting help from my Dad once and a while.  Mostly he will be checking my posts for spelling errors and helping me if I get stuck.\r\n\r\n## Blog Post 2 - Web Site Ideas\r\n####July 25th 2014\r\nThis is my second blog post about making money on the web.  Yesterday, I decided that I would work on a web site for myself.  I need to come up with an idea for a web site.  Here are some ideas I had:\r\n\r\n1.  A web site about how to program games using Construct 2 - tutorials\r\n2.  A web site that helps kids find sponsors for things like art and science projects\r\n3.  A web comic\r\n4.  A site with programming tutorials\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about it, I am trying to become a better programmer, so I am going to try to start a web site that has programming tutorials.  I want to learn about javascript and more html.  So I will start with that idea and will post about programming as I learn it.  The next step will be getting a web site set up on Wix or another web site host.  \r\n\r\nOne thing that I am going to start doing is posting a summary at the end of each post:\r\n\r\n####Summary####\r\n\r\n|             | $   |    From what?                                                    |\r\n|--------------------|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Money spent so far | $10 | [Namecheap.com](http://namecheap.com) (I'll post about that soon)|\r\n| Money made so far  | $0  |                                                                  |\r\n\r\n*The table above was created using [Tables Generator - www.tablesgenerator.com](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables#)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Blog Post 1 - Web Business Ideas\r\nFor my first post, I need to decide what kind of web businesses I am going to try to create.  When I say **web business**, I really mean anything that is either web or on mobile.  Some of my options are:\r\n\r\n1. this web site - can I make money from it?\r\n2. create a web game - I have programmed with Construct 2, but haven't made any money from them\r\n3. create a mobile game - me and my dad worked on a couple of games on the iPhone but never published them\r\n4. create a Youtube channel - me and my cousin made a Youtube channel called [SilverDuckFilms](https://www.youtube.com/user/SilverDuckFilms) which are mostly Minecraft Fail videos\r\n5. create a web site for myself - I have made a few websites before using Wix\r\n6. create a web site for other people - This would be me charging other people to create web sites for them\r\n\r\nThere are some other options, but those are some starting ideas.  One of my goals is to get my businesses started with as little money as possible.  That way, if I fail, it didn't cost that much and I can move onto another idea.\r\n\r\nSince I am really interested in the web, I have decided that I will try to create a web site for myself (idea number 5).  On my next blog post, I will try to think of different ideas for the web site.  I already have a few ideas.","google":"UA-8129460-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
