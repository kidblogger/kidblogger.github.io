{"name":"Kid Income Blog","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to Kid Income Blog\r\nHello.  Welcome to my blog.  My name is Isaac V. and I am 13 years old.  I like to play video games, skate on my longboard, and program.  I am going to be using this blog to show others how to make income on the web.  I am starting with the basics and will try to create a web business that makes money.  Along the way, I will be learning about web business and I will show all of the steps that it took to get there.  I will be getting help from my Dad once and a while.\r\n\r\n### Blog Post 1 - Web Business Ideas\r\nFor my first post, I need to decide what kind of web businesses I am going to try to create.  When I say **web business**, I really mean anything that is either web or on mobile.  Some of my options are:\r\n\r\n1. this web site - can I make money from it?\r\n2. create a web game - I have programmed with Construct 2, but haven't made any money from them\r\n3. create a mobile game - me and my dad worked on a couple of games on the iPhone but never published them\r\n4. create a Youtube channel - me and my cousin made a Youtube channel called [SilverDuckFilms](https://www.youtube.com/user/SilverDuckFilms) which are mostly Minecraft Fail videos\r\n5. create a web site for myself - I have made a few websites before using Wix\r\n6. create a web site for other people - This would be me charging other people to create web sites for them\r\n\r\nThere are some other options, but those are some starting ideas.  One of my goals is to get my businesses started with as little money as possible.  That way, if I fail, it didn't cost that much and I can move onto another idea.","google":"UA-8129460-7","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
