<p>Hello.  Welcome to my blog.  My name is Isaac V. and I am 13 years old.  I like to play video games, skate on my longboard, and program.  I am going to be using this blog to show others how to make income on the web.  I am starting with the basics and will try to create several web businesses that make money.  Along the way, I will be learning about web business and I will show all of the steps that it took to get there.  I will be getting help from my Dad once and a while.</p>

<p>For my first post, I need to decide what kind of web businesses I am going to try to create.  When I say <strong>web business</strong>, I really mean anything that is either web or mobile.  Some of my options could be:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a web game</li>
<li>create a mobile game</li>
<li>create a Youtube channel</li>
<li>create a web site for myself</li>
<li>create a web site for other people</li>
</ol><p>There are some other options, but those are some starting ideas.  One of my goals is to get my businesses started with as little money as possible.  That way, if I fail, it didn't cost that much and I can move onto another idea.</p>
