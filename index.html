<p>Hello.  Welcome to my blog.  My name is Isaac V. and I am 13 years old.  I like to play video games, skate on my longboard, and program.  I am going to be using this blog to show others how to make income on the web.  I am starting with the basics and will try to create a web business that makes money.  Along the way, I will be learning about web business and I will show all of the steps that it took to get there.  I will be getting help from my Dad once and a while.  Mostly he will be checking my posts for spelling and grammer errors and helping me if I get stuck.</p>

<p>This is my second blog post about making money on the web.  Yesterday, I decided that I would work on a web site for myself.  I need to come up with an idea for a web site.  Here are some ideas I had:</p>

<ol>
<li> A web site about how to program games using Construct 2 - tutorials</li>
<li> A web site that helps kids find sponsors for things like art and science projects</li>
<li> A web comic</li>
<li> A site with programming tutorials</li>
</ol><p>After thinking about it, I am trying to become a better programmer, so I am going to try to start a web site that has programming tutorials.  I want to learn about javascript and more html.  So I will start with that idea and will post about programming as I learn it.  The next step will be getting a web site set up on <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> or maybe <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. </p>

<p>One thing that I am going to start doing is posting a summary at the end of each post:</p>

<h4>

<p>For my first post, I need to decide what kind of web businesses I am going to try to create.  When I say <strong>web business</strong>, I really mean anything that is either web or on mobile.  Some of my options are:</p>

<ol>
<li>this web site - can I make money from it?</li>
<li>create a web game - I have programmed with Construct 2, but haven't made any money from them</li>
<li>create a mobile game - me and my dad worked on a couple of games on the iPhone but never published them</li>
<li>create a Youtube channel - me and my cousin made a Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SilverDuckFilms">SilverDuckFilms</a> which are mostly Minecraft Fail videos</li>
<li>create a web site for myself - I have made a few websites before using Wix</li>
<li>create a web site for other people - This would be me charging other people to create web sites for them</li>
</ol><p>There are some other options, but those are some starting ideas.  One of my goals is to get my businesses started with as little money as possible.  That way, if I fail, it didn't cost that much and I can move onto another idea.</p>

<p>Since I am really interested in the web, I have decided that I will try to create a web site for myself (idea number 5).  On my next blog post, I will try to think of different ideas for the web site.  I already have a few ideas.</p>
